### Name Origin

[Shaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaku_(unit)), or &ldquo;Japanese foot&rdquo; is a Japanese unit of length derived (but varying) from the Chinese chi, originally based upon the length of the forearm. It seemed that a project that demonstrated distance metrics should have a distance-based name. We started in the Japanese naming scheme because of an external project code named SAMURAI. Since then our applications (Ronin, Kyudo) have followed a Japanese martial naming convention.
